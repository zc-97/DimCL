# DimCL: Dimension-Aware Augmentation in Contrastive Learning for Recommendation
PyTorch implementation of the paper "DimCL: Dimension-Aware Augmentation in Contrastive Learning for Recommendation", KDD' 25

---
Our model DimCL is implemented based on the [SELFRec](https://github.com/Coder-Yu/SELFRec) framework.

Models and configurations for different backbones can be found in "**_model/graph_**" and "**_conf_**" directories:

LightGCN+DimCL = "Dimcl.py" and "Dimcl.conf"

SimGCL+DimCL** = "FinalSimDimCL.py" and "FinalSimDimCL.conf"

XSimGCL+DimCL = "DimXsimCL.py" and "DimXsimCL.conf"
